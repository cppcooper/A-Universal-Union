# Other Tools

## Well-known Digital Democracy Platforms

**Loomio (New Zealand)** — decision-making platform designed for groups/organizations; threaded discussions, polls, consensus tracking.

**Polis (Taiwan/Global)** — large-scale deliberation tool using machine learning to cluster opinions and surface consensus points (famously used in Taiwan’s vTaiwan process).

**Consul Democracy (Spain/Latin America)** — open-source platform for proposals, debates, participatory budgeting; adopted in Madrid and across Latin America.

**Your Priorities (Iceland/Global)** — crowdsourcing platform for citizens to propose and prioritize ideas (used in Iceland’s constitutional crowdsourcing and in Scotland).

**CivicTech / vTaiwan process** — ecosystem combining Polis with government facilitation, producing binding or semi-binding consensus outcomes.

## Voting & Governance Systems

**LiquidFeedback (Germany/Pirate Parties)** — platform for liquid democracy (delegable voting).

**DemocracyOS (Argentina)** — early open-source platform for online voting and deliberation.

**Quadratic Voting pilots (Colorado legislature, RadicalxChange projects)** — experiments in weighted voting to surface preference intensity.

## Participation & Engagement Platforms

**CitizenLab (Belgium/Global)** — SaaS platform for cities; crowdsourced ideas, consultations, participatory budgeting.

**Bang the Table (EngagementHQ) (Australia/Global)** — civic engagement software for municipalities; surveys, discussions, storytelling.

**OpenGov (US-focused)** — civic transparency and engagement tools, especially for local government budgets.

## Supporting Tech / Ecosystems

**Open Collective** — transparent budgeting for communities and DAOs.

**DAO frameworks (Aragon, Colony, DAOstack)** — blockchain-based organizational governance with voting and treasury tools.

**Metagov & PolicyKit** — research/experimental tools for algorithmic governance in online communities.

# What makes A Universal Union stand apart?

**Unified Feature Set:** Existing tools specialize in one or two functions (deliberation, voting, budgeting). AUU integrates all layers: discussion, identity, trust, voting, analytics, federation, and blockchain anchoring.

**Privacy + Accountability:** Unlike most platforms, AUU combines pseudonymity with trust graphs, making abuse structurally unsustainable while protecting dissidents and minorities.

**Post-Quantum Security:** Designed from the ground up for crypto-agility and PQC readiness — absent in current platforms.

**Federated + Global:** Supports local collectives, global federations, and cross-border alliances without losing autonomy.

**Resilient Against Abuse:** Tools like differential privacy, NLP clustering, and Sybil resistance mean manipulative actors (corporations, states, extremists) are exposed rather than empowered.

**Augment, Not Replace:** AUU is explicitly built as a civic layer that governments, organizations, and communities can adopt in parallel to brick-and-mortar governance.
